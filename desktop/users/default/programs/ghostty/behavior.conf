# Ghostty Behavior Configuration
# Terminal behavior, shell integration, and non-visual settings

# Enables the ability to move the cursor at prompts by using `alt+click` on
# Linux and `option+click` on macOS.
#
# This feature requires shell integration (specifically prompt marking
# via `OSC 133`) and only works in primary screen mode. Alternate screen
# applications like vim usually have their own version of this feature but
# this configuration doesn't control that.
#
# It should be noted that this feature works by translating your desired
# position into a series of synthetic arrow key movements, so some weird
# behavior around edge cases are to be expected. This is unfortunately how
# this feature is implemented across terminals because there isn't any other
# way to implement it.
cursor-click-to-move = true

# Hide the mouse immediately when typing. The mouse becomes visible again
# when the mouse is used (button, movement, etc.). Platform-specific behavior
# may dictate other scenarios where the mouse is shown. For example on macOS,
# the mouse is shown again when a new window, tab, or split is created.
mouse-hide-while-typing = false

# Determines whether running programs can detect the shift key pressed with a
# mouse click. Typically, the shift key is used to extend mouse selection.
#
# The default value of `false` means that the shift key is not sent with
# the mouse protocol and will extend the selection. This value can be
# conditionally overridden by the running program with the `XTSHIFTESCAPE`
# sequence.
#
# The value `true` means that the shift key is sent with the mouse protocol
# but the running program can override this behavior with `XTSHIFTESCAPE`.
#
# The value `never` is the same as `false` but the running program cannot
# override this behavior with `XTSHIFTESCAPE`. The value `always` is the
# same as `true` but the running program cannot override this behavior with
# `XTSHIFTESCAPE`.
#
# If you always want shift to extend mouse selection even if the program
# requests otherwise, set this to `never`.
#
# Valid values are:
#
#   * `true`
#   * `false`
#   * `always`
#   * `never`
#
mouse-shift-capture = true

# Multiplier for scrolling distance with the mouse wheel. Any value less
# than 0.01 or greater than 10,000 will be clamped to the nearest valid
# value.
#
# A value of "1" (default) scrolls te default amount. A value of "2" scrolls
# double the default amount. A value of "0.5" scrolls half the default amount.
# Et cetera.
mouse-scroll-multiplier = 1

# The command to run, usually a shell. If this is not an absolute path, it'll
# be looked up in the `PATH`. If this is not set, a default will be looked up
# from your system. The rules for the default lookup are:
#
#   * `SHELL` environment variable
#
#   * `passwd` entry (user information)
#
# This can contain additional arguments to run the command with. If additional
# arguments are provided, the command will be executed using `/bin/sh -c`.
# Ghostty does not do any shell command parsing.
#
# This command will be used for all new terminal surfaces, i.e. new windows,
# tabs, etc. If you want to run a command only for the first terminal surface
# created when Ghostty starts, use the `initial-command` configuration.
#
# Ghostty supports the common `-e` flag for executing a command with
# arguments. For example, `ghostty -e fish --with --custom --args`.
# This flag sets the `initial-command` configuration, see that for more
# information.
command =

# This is the same as "command", but only applies to the first terminal
# surface created when Ghostty starts. Subsequent terminal surfaces will use
# the `command` configuration.
#
# After the first terminal surface is created (or closed), there is no
# way to run this initial command again automatically. As such, setting
# this at runtime works but will only affect the next terminal surface
# if it is the first one ever created.
#
# If you're using the `ghostty` CLI there is also a shortcut to set this
# with arguments directly: you can use the `-e` flag. For example: `ghostty -e
# fish --with --custom --args`. The `-e` flag automatically forces some
# other behaviors as well:
#
#   * `gtk-single-instance=false` - This ensures that a new instance is
#     launched and the CLI args are respected.
#
#   * `quit-after-last-window-closed=true` - This ensures that the Ghostty
#     process will exit when the command exits. Additionally, the
#     `quit-after-last-window-closed-delay` is unset.
#
#   * `shell-integration=detect` (if not `none`) - This prevents forcibly
#     injecting any configured shell integration into the command's
#     environment. With `-e` its highly unlikely that you're executing a
#     shell and forced shell integration is likely to cause problems
#     (i.e. by wrapping your command in a shell, setting env vars, etc.).
#     This is a safety measure to prevent unexpected behavior. If you want
#     shell integration with a `-e`-executed command, you must either
#     name your binary appopriately or source the shell integration script
#     manually.
#
initial-command =

# If true, keep the terminal open after the command exits. Normally, the

#
# This is primarily useful for scripts or debugging.

# The number of milliseconds of runtime below which we consider a process exit
# to be abnormal. This is used to show an error message when the process exits

# any exit code because of the way shell processes are launched via the login
# command.

# The size of the scrollback buffer in bytes. This also includes the active

# allocated for the visible screen and anything leftover is the limit for
# the scrollback.
#
# When this limit is reached, the oldest lines are removed from the
# scrollback.
#
# Scrollback currently exists completely in memory. This means that the
# larger this value, the larger potential memory usage. Scrollback is
# allocated lazily up to this limit, so if you set this to a very large
# value, it will not immediately consume a lot of memory.
#
# This size is per terminal surface, not for the entire application.
#
# It is not currently possible to set an unlimited scrollback buffer.
# This is a future planned feature.
#
# This can be changed at runtime but will only affect new terminal surfaces.

#
# This controls the class field of the `WM_CLASS` X11 property (when running
# under X11), and the Wayland application ID (when running under Wayland).

# Note that changing this value between invocations will create new, separate
# instances, of Ghostty when running with `gtk-single-instance=true`. See that
# option for more details.
#
# The class name must follow the requirements defined [in the GTK
# documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gio/type_func.Application.id_is_valid.html).
#

#
# This only affects GTK builds.

#
# This setting is secondary to the `window-inherit-working-directory`

# setting will be used. Typically, this setting is used only for the first
# window.
#
# The default is `inherit` except in special scenarios listed next. On macOS,
# if Ghostty can detect it is launched from launchd (double-clicked) or
# `open`, then it defaults to `home`. On Linux with GTK, if Ghostty can detect
# it was launched from a desktop launcher, then it defaults to `home`.
#

#
#   * `inherit` - The working directory of the launching process.

# their position, size, tabs, splits, etc. Some window state requires shell
# integration, such as preserving working directories. See `shell-integration`
# for more information.
#
# There are three valid values for this configuration:
#
#   * `default` will use the default system behavior. On macOS, this
#     will only save state if the application is forcibly terminated
#     or if it is configured systemwide via Settings.app.
#
#   * `never` will never save window state.
#
#   * `always` will always save window state whenever Ghostty is exited.
#
# If you change this value to `never` while Ghostty is not running, the next
# Ghostty launch will NOT restore the window state.
#
# If you change this value to `default` while Ghostty is not running and the
# previous exit saved state, the next Ghostty launch will still restore the
# window state. This is because Ghostty cannot know if the previous exit was
# due to a forced save or not (macOS doesn't provide this information).
#
# If you change this value so that window state is saved while Ghostty is not
# running, the previous window state will not be restored because Ghostty only
# saves state on exit if this is enabled.

#
# Middle-click paste will always use the selection clipboard on Linux
# and the system clipboard on macOS. Middle-click paste is always enabled

# configuration below:
#
# ```
# config-file = "foo"
# a = 1

#   * `s` - one second.
#   * `ms` - one millisecond, or 0.001 second.
#   * `us` or `µs` - one microsecond, or 0.000001 second.
#   * `ns` - one nanosecond, or 0.000000001 second.
#
# Examples:
#   * `1h30m`
#   * `45s`
#
# Units can be repeated and will be added together. This means that

#
#  * `mouse` - The screen that the mouse is currently hovered over.
#
#  * `macos-menu-bar` - The screen that contains the macOS menu bar as

# Put every surface (tab, split, window) into a dedicated Linux cgroup.
#
# This makes it so that resource management can be done on a per-surface
# granularity. For example, if a shell program is using too much memory,
# only that shell will be killed by the oom monitor instead of the entire
# Ghostty process. Similarly, if a shell program is using too much CPU,
# only that surface will be CPU-throttled.
#
# This will cause startup times to be slower (a hundred milliseconds or so),
# so the default value is "single-instance." In single-instance mode, only
# one instance of Ghostty is running (see gtk-single-instance) so the startup

#   * `never` - Never use cgroups.

# systemd-oom to handle killing processes that have too much memory
# pressure.

# will be allowed to fail and the failure is ignored. This is useful if
# you view cgroup isolation as a "nice to have" and not a critical resource
# management feature, because Ghostty startup will not fail if cgroup APIs
# fail.
#
# If this is true, then any cgroup initialization failure will cause
# Ghostty to exit or new surfaces to not be created.

#
# The default value is `detect` which will default to `true` if Ghostty
# detects that it was launched from the `.desktop` file such as an app
# launcher (like Gnome Shell)  or by D-Bus activation. If Ghostty is launched
# from the command line, it will default to `false`.

# protocols (specifically this will enable `modifyOtherKeys`), among other

# Control the auto-update functionality of Ghostty. This is only supported
# on macOS currently, since Linux builds are distributed via package
# managers that are not centrally controlled by Ghostty.
#
# Checking or downloading an update does not send any information to
# the project beyond standard network information mandated by the
# underlying protocols. To put it another way: Ghostty doesn't explicitly
# add any tracking to the update process. The update process works by
# downloading information about the latest version and comparing it
# client-side to the current version.
#
# Valid values are:
#
#  * `off` - Disable auto-updates.
#  * `check` - Check for updates and notify the user if an update is
#    available, but do not automatically download or install the update.
#  * `download` - Check for updates, automatically download the update,
#    notify the user, but do not automatically install the update.

# The default value is `check`.

# The default value of this matches the release channel of the currently
# running Ghostty version. If you download a pre-release version of Ghostty
# then this will be set to `tip` and you will receive pre-release updates.
# If you download a stable version of Ghostty then this will be set to
# `stable` and you will receive stable updates.
#
# Valid values are:
#
#  * `stable` - Stable, tagged releases such as "1.0.0".
#  * `tip` - Pre-release versions generated from each commit to the
#    main branch. This is the version that was in use during private
#    beta testing by thousands of people. It is generally stable but
#    will likely have more bugs than the stable channel.
#
# Changing this configuration requires a full restart of
# Ghostty to take effect.
#
# This only works on macOS since only macOS has an auto-update feature.
